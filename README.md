Easily build a next generation portal application using microfrontends. Piral enables you to create a modular frontend application that is extended at runtime with decoupled modules called *pilets* leveraging a **microfrontend architecture**. A pilet can be **developed independently** and ships with the necessary code, as well as all other relevant assets.

This makes Piral an ideal foundation for a mid-sized to large-scale applications developed by **distributed teams**.

:zap: A pilet is capable of dynamically **extending other pilets** or using such extension slots itself.

:zap: A pilet is **isolated** (developed and handled) and will never destroy your application.

:zap: A pilet can be developed with **any technology** using a **standard IDE**.

:zap: A pilet can be updated and **published within seconds**.

## Getting Started

Piral itself is developed as a monorepo. As such this repository may contain an overwhelming amount of information.

Our recommendation is to start at the documentation available at [docs.piral.io](https://docs.piral.io). Working through the available [tutorials](https://docs.piral.io/tutorials) will give you the necessary information in the best possible order.
